<p>During my role as Lead Data Scientist at TTEC Digital, I have had the privilege of contributing to a wide array of projects, with a focus on serving automobile and insurance-based clients, including esteemed names such as General Motors (GM) and Kaiser Permanente. These experiences have been both enriching and impactful.</p>

<p>One of the standout projects I've been involved in is in collaboration with General Motors. Specifically, we concentrated on the Customer Care and After Sales division. In this capacity, I played a pivotal role in developing predictive models aimed at forecasting dealer retention and service level retention. These models were designed to provide insights at various levels, spanning dealers, vehicle categories, and timeframes, including monthly and yearly forecasts. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, we were able to enhance GM's understanding of customer behavior, allowing for more strategic decision-making in dealer management and service delivery.</p>

<p>In another noteworthy endeavor, I had the opportunity to work closely with Kaiser Permanente. For this client, I led the development and implementation of an end-to-end data pipeline. This pipeline was designed to ingest, process, prepare, transform, and enrich structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data in a governed and efficient manner. This robust data infrastructure has significantly improved Kaiser Permanente's ability to harness insights from their data, enhancing their decision-making processes and operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I took the initiative to optimize pilot routing between agents and customers by developing a PTB (Propensity To Buy) model using cutting-edge AI and ML techniques. This model has had a substantial impact on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of customer interactions, ultimately benefiting both the company and its clients.</p>

<p>My tenure at TTEC Digital has allowed me to not only work on diverse and impactful projects but also to continually expand my expertise in data science and its applications in the automotive and insurance industries. I am proud to have contributed to projects that have made a tangible difference in improving customer experiences, operational efficiency, and decision-making for our clients.</p>
